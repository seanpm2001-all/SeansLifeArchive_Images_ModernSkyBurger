# December 31st 2020 - Didn't play

I didn't play Modern Sky Burger today. I took a break from it, as I don't care much about the modern version of the game. I miss the classic version.

There is still a chance I might play the modern version of this game in the future, however, I won't enjoy it as much as the 2012 version of the game.

As of October 22nd 2020, the game has been deleted off my old phone. I have been using this template for too many days before the target date (The December 4th entry was written in early November) and I didn't account for my new phone. I have since re-downloaded it.

As of November 13th 2020, I have re-downloaded it, but as of December 31st 2020, I haven't touched it yet. Maybe I will play it again sometime in 2021?
