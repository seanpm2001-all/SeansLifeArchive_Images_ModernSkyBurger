# October 9th 2020 - Didn't play

I didn't play Modern Sky Burger today. I took a break from it, as I don't care much about the modern version of the game. I miss the classic version.

There is still a chance I might play the modern version of this game in the future, however, I won't enjoy it as much as the 2012 version of the game.
