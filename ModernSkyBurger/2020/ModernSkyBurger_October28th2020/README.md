# October 28th 2020 - Didn't play

I didn't play Modern Sky Burger today. I took a break from it, as I don't care much about the modern version of the game. I miss the classic version.

There is still a chance I might play the modern version of this game in the future, however, I won't enjoy it as much as the 2012 version of the game.

As of October 22nd 2020, the game has been deleted off my phone. As of today, it has not yet been added back.
